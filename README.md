# Plane Animation With GSAP
It's just a plane flying around and shooting a crooked text.

# Why did I do this?
I was reviewing a co-worker PR, and he used a library called "GSAP", I didn't know why he used that, so I run his code and there was a really kick-ass animation. So, I didn't know how to spend a saturday morning, that's why I tried to do this... 

Just for fun.

# That's ok, but... what did you do?
